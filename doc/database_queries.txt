This file documents the SQL queries used by the web interface to pull data
from the database tables documented in: doc/database_tables.txt

1) Generate inventory

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE beers_bought_tmp AS (
    SELECT   beer_id,
             SUM(amount) AS count
    FROM     beers_bougth
    GROUP BY beer_id
);

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE beers_sold_tmp AS (
    SELECT   user_id,
             beer_id,
             COUNT(beer_id) AS count
    FROM     beers_sold
    GROUP BY beer_id
);

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE inventory_tmp AS (
    SELECT    beers_bought_tmp.beer_id,
              COALESCE(beers_bought_tmp.count, 0) - COALESCE(beers_sold_tmp.count, 0) AS count 
    FROM      beers_bought_tmp 
    LEFT JOIN beers_sold_tmp ON beers_bought_tmp.beer_id = beers_sold_tmp.beer_id;
);

SELECT * FROM inventory_tmp;


2) Generate IOU list 

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE time_charged_tmp AS (
    SELECT bs.user_id,
           bs.beer_id,
           bs.timestamp AS time_sold,
           (SELECT MAX(bb.timestamp)
            FROM   beers_bougth bb
            WHERE  bb.beer_id = bs.beer_id and
                   bb.timestamp <= bs.timestamp
           ) as time_bougth
    FROM beers_sold bs
    ORDER BY bs.user_id
);

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE beers_sold_at_price_tmp AS (
    SELECT tc.user_id,
           tc.beer_id,
           u.username,
           u.first_name,
           u.last_name,
           bb.price
    FROM   time_charged_tmp tc,
           beers_bougth bb, users u
    WHERE  tc.beer_id = bb.beer_id and
           tc.time_bougth = bb.timestamp and
           u.user_id = tc.user_id
);

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE beers_bougth_total_tmp AS (
    SELECT user_id,
           username,
           first_name,
           last_name,
           SUM(price) AS amount
           FROM beers_sold_at_price_tmp
           GROUP BY user_id
           ORDER BY amount DESC
);

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE payments_total_tmp AS (
    SELECT user_id,
           SUM(amount) as total
    FROM payments
    GROUP BY user_id
);

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE iou_tmp AS (
    SELECT    bb.user_id,
              bb.username,
              bb.first_name,
              bb.last_name,
              COALESCE(bb.amount, 0) - COALESCE(pa.total, 0) AS amount
    FROM      beers_bougth_total_tmp bb
    LEFT JOIN payments_total_tmp pa ON bb.user_id = pa.user_id
);
